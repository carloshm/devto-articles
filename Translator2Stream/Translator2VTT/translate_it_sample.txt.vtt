00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000


00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:31.000


00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000


00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's in English, too.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Ok.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So then what you review is to open 12 windows that way and stay connected while the presentation is being made.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
At the end of the presentation each of those 12 windows download.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The corresponding subtitle which is a txt ficherito, no, as far as I have seen.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The transcript.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And those 12 transcripts. I guess we'd have to check the Tex Tos. I guess or so. No.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Those 12 transcripts go out to the stream part.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And once we're there, take the video and load the 12 files with the 11 hand because the English. You don't need subtitling. The 11 files with the 11 transcripts.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It allows steam to configure each file you upload to it by associating the language to which it corresponds.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And when that was made that same recording with those 11 files loaded.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It could be published so that each user when playing can select the captioning on which they want to view it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Is that it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Yes.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Uh.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I'm reading in the easy part. Apart from the English to see how he's translating it for me.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Siri.
